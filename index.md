# Introduction

> “An article about computational science in a scientific publication is not the scholarship itself, it is merely advertising of the scholarship. The actual scholarship is the complete software development environment and the complete set of instructions which generated the figures.”
> - Buckheit and Donoho (1995)

Over the last decade, the volume of conference submissions in machine learning has broken records across the sciences. According to some estimates, submissions at machine learning conferences account for over 0.5% of all scientific papers published today. While submissions are at an all-time high, the pace of scientific progress has not grown in kind. The current pandemic gives researchers a long-awaited opportunity to pause and reflect: what kind of legacy do we want to leave behind? Is it in the number of papers we publish, or the number of citations we accumulate? Researchers across the field have raised important questions regarding the effectiveness of these metrics and how to measure progress over the next decade.

How should we evaluate scientific papers to create a more sustainable platform for future contributors? Many proposals have emerged, from novelty and rigor, to reproducibility ([Pineau et al., 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.12206.pdf)), explainability ([Olah and Carter, 2017](https://distill.pub/2017/research-debt/)) and accessibility. We believe that in an era of social isolation and remote work, the importance of clear communication is crucial, both for demonstrating scientific progress and building human intuition and understanding. We propose taking a more wholistic view of the conference paper, not just as a medium for communicating with a highly sophisticated audience, but as a tool for disseminating knowledge to the next generation of scientific researchers. In this workshop, we propose to discuss three high-level themes:

* Accessibility and inclusivity - How do we design a inclusive publication format for ML research?
* Explainability and pedagogy - How do we communicate ML research and theory more effectively?
* Interpretability and visualization - How do we interpret complex information in a visual setting?

The research paper as originally envisioned, was a document printed and bound in journals: over time, these documents were published online and underwent minor cosmetic changes, yet many assumptions of the original format survive, namely, that research must take the form of a paper artifact. Yet modern ML research often contains multimedia and rich interactive applications which most print-based document formats cannot support. To accommodate the diversity of new content, authors and publishers must adopt a more inclusive format for sharing scientific research and redesign conference publications to meet the evolving information needs of both authors and readers alike.

How much research is overlooked due to inaccessible communication? How many papers will be as readable in ten or twenty years? How can we make the proceedings more accessible for future generations of ML researchers? These are a few of the questions we plan to discuss in our workshop. Please join us for an exciting discussion on redesigning the scientific paper for the next decade of machine learning research!

# Call for Papers

We invite submissions describing novel formats for publishing scientific research, with an emphasis on presentation, accessibility, and reproducibility. Each submission must clearly outline its design goals, and importantly, compare them with current publishing formats (e.g., LaTeX + PDF workflows). Submissions include, but are not limited to:

* Position papers that summarize existing tools for scientific dissemination and discuss viable alternatives.
* Analysis papers that investigate or quantitatively compare current tools for scientific dissemination and presentation.
* Exhibits that present a novel format for scientific research dissemination. (Such exhibits are the primary focus of this workshop, and this will be highlighted in our call for papers)

Submissions are solicited in PDF format for position and analysis papers. For exhibits, there is no restriction on the format (creative new formats welcome, as long as they are cross-platform compatible on most modern web browsers). By example, we suggest the following areas of help structure submissions, however other proposals will also be considered:

* **Presentation**: How does the proposed new format improve clarity, content delivery, and interactivity?
* **Accessibility**: How accessible is the proposed format? Think cross-platform, cross-user, and longevity.
* **Review cycle**: In what manner is the proposed format best reviewed? How would version control look like, for such a format? What technical skills does this expect of a reviewer?
* **Bibliometrics**: Are there more meaningful bibliometrics to measure the impact of articles in the proposed format? If so, how would they integrate into the existing rubric of h-indices, impact factors, and citation counts?
* **Interoperability**: Can these formats be converted back or from others, such as PDFs, blog posts, etc?
* **Durability**: Will these new formats remain accessible in case of server failure or bitrot? How can we ensure that submissions remain accessible for many decades to come?

Adversarial perspectives welcome! Submissions arguing in favor of current methods (such as LaTeX + PDF workflows) will be equally well-received.
